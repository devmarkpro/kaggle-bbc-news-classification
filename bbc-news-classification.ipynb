who is now an ioc member - all wanted to know why anyone would want to run that far. you d have thought all these athletes  who have been running for most of their lives  wouldn t think it would be that bad. but the only person who was positive about my intentions was tanni grey thompson  who has won the london marathon wheelchair race six times. even though it was a very busy week entertaining the international olympic committee s (ioc) evaluation commission  i actually found my running schedule easier to follow. when i m at home  i get distracted by all sorts of things but for the five days i was in london  i was in a pressurised situation  but i found it easy to relax by running.  on wednesday  the presentations to the ioc team did not finish until the early evening  so i just managed to squeeze in a 45-minute run. we had an early start on thursday because we had to visit all the olympic sites around london  that was pretty shattering  but when we got back to the hotel  i got back on the treadmill. on friday evening i went along to the special dinner at buckingham palace which was a nice occasion. i never feel guilty about eating  especially when i m exercising. and because it was a rest day i didn t have to feel bad about missing my training either. anyway  i managed to do another quick run on saturday ahead of the final ioc presentations  before heading home for my daughter s birthday.  when i was in london i did all of my runs on the treadmill  which isn t the same as exercising outdoors. one of the ioc s technical staff from australia ran alongside me one day. we talked about the sydney olympics and that made the time go past more quickly. i do find it quite comfortable running in the gym because there is more cushioning. but when you re gearing up to running on the road you need your body to get used to that jarring feeling when your feet hit the pavement. it was good to get out on the road for my long run on sunday. after the week i d had i was a bit concerned i wouldn t be able to complete it. but i coped with it very well and  even though it was bitterly cold  i put in 15-and-a-half miles - only another 11 to go then.  - this year steve will donate all the proceeds from his london marathon efforts to victims of the tsunami.steve will be writing a regular column on the ups and downs of his marathon training for the bbc sport website.he will be raising money through the steve redgrave trust which supports the association of children s hospices  the children with leukaemia charity  and the trust s own project which aims to provide inner-city schools with rowing equipment.\",\n          \"strong quarterly growth for nike nike has reported its best second-quarter earnings  helped by strong demand for its athletic shoes and converse sneakers.  the global sports giant said it posted a profit of $261.9m (\\u00a3135.6m)  for the three months to 30 november  up from $179.1m in the same period last year. revenues increased 11% to $3.1bn  from $2.8bn for the same period in 2003. nike  whose products are endorsed by tiger woods among other sports stars  said  demand continues to grow . the results came after a strong first quarter of the year for the firm based in beaverton  oregon.  philip knight  chairman and chief executive  said:  nike s second-quarter revenues and earnings per share reached all-time high levels as a result of solid performance across our global portfolio.  our businesses in the united states and emerging markets such as china  russia and turkey  combined with favourable european exchange rates  helped drive much of this growth.  he added:  with the first half of our fiscal year in the books  we remain confident that our business strategy and consistent execution will allow us to deliver on our goals of healthy  profitable growth.  the firm reported worldwide futures orders for athletic footwear and gear  scheduled for delivery from december 2004 to april 2005  of $4.9bn. that is 9.1% higher than such orders reported for the same period last year.\",\n          \"golden rule  intact  says ex-aide chancellor gordon brown will meet his golden economic rule  with a margin to spare   according to his former chief economic adviser.  formerly one of mr brown s closest treasury aides  ed balls hinted at a budget giveaway on 16 march. he said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. any rate rise ahead of an expected may election would not affect the labour party s chances of winning  he added. last july  mr balls won the right to step down from his treasury position and run for parliament  defending the labour stronghold of normanton in west yorkshire.  mr balls rejected the allegation that mr brown had been sidelined in the election campaign  saying he was playing a  different  role to the one he played in the last two elections. he rejected speculation that mr brown was considering becoming foreign secretary  saying his recent travels had been linked to efforts to boost international development. gordon brown s decision to announce the date of the budget while on a trip to china was a  sensible thing to do   since he was talking about skills and investment at the time  mr balls told the bbc. commenting on speculation of an interest rate rise  he said it was not within the remit of the bank of england s monetary policy committee (mpc) to factor a potential election into its rate decisions. expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed that house prices are still rising. consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in january.  i don t believe it would be a big election issue in britain or a problem for labour   mr balls said. prime minister tony blair has yet to name the date of the election  but most pundits are betting on 5 may as the likely day.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

left newcastle to join celtic on loan after a major row with souness. souness - who refused to refer to the 25-year-old by name - said bellamy did not score enough goals  the chap that s just gone has scored 9.3 goals a season in his time in senior football - half of those weren t even in the top flight   said souness.  that s not good enough for a striker at a club like this.  we need to have two strikers who are near 20 goals on a regular basis.   bellamy turned down a move to birmingham in favour of joining celtic after a disagreement about the welsh international playing out of position quickly escalated. earlier in the week  souness had said that he risked losing the confidence of the players and damaging his own reputation if he had not taken a hard line after bellamy accused him of lying.   there are certain things you can forgive and forget   said souness.  but if i d been seen to be weak in this case there was no future for me with the players in the dressing room or any job i have after newcastle.  he could then return to st james  park - and he says that he wants to. however  it would seem unlikely he will play for newcastle again as long as souness remains in

        "Finally, we evaluated the clustering-based classification using a confusion matrix and calculated overall accuracy. The confusion matrix reveals that most samples are correctly grouped into their true categories, with a few misclassifications primarily between related classes such as business and politics. The approach achieved a training accuracy of approximately $88.7%$ and a test accuracy of approximately $88.9%$, indicating that the cluster-to-label mapping generalizes well to unseen data. These results demonstrate that even an unsupervised technique like KMeans, when combined with majority label assignment, can effectively approximate the original categories in this dataset."

The silhouette score is calculated for each sample in the dataset and then averaged to get the overall score. A higher silhouette score indicates better clustering performance.\n",

The detailed classification report shows consistently high precision, recall, and F1-scores across all categories, with particularly perfect scores for the sport class and very strong results for business, entertainment, politics, and tech. These findings demonstrate that even a relatively simple supervised model can effectively capture the distinctions among categories in this dataset.\n",

I preprocessed the text data using GloVe embeddings and dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and Truncated SVD. The clustering results were mapped back to the original categories, achieving a test accuracy of approximately 88.9%. Hyperparameter tuning improved the model's performance further, with a test accuracy of approximately 91.3%. Finally, I trained a supervised logistic regression model on the original document vectors, achieving a test accuracy of approximately 97.3%. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of both unsupervised and supervised learning approaches for text classification tasks."

        "To investigate how the amount of training data influences model performance, we trained the logistic regression classifier on progressively larger fractions of the training set, ranging from $1%$ to nearly $100%$. The results show that the test accuracy increased rapidly with the addition of more data: starting at ~$46%$ with just $1%$ of the data, surpassing $90%$ by around $5%$, and reaching over $97%$ once about $95%$ of the data was used. Beyond this point, the accuracy plateaued, indicating that the model had effectively learned the patterns in the data. This analysis highlights the significant impact of training set size on classifier performance, especially in the early stages, and confirms that our dataset is sufficiently large to achieve strong generalization.\n",
